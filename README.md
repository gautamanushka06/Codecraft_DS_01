ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s world of data-driven decision-making, understanding global population trends is critical for governments, organizations, and policy-makers. The goal of this project is to analyze the population data of countries across the globe, identify the top 10 most populous nations, and understand the overall distribution of population in the year 2022.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Identify and visualize the top 10 countries with the highest population in 2022.

Analyze the distribution of population across all countries.

Present insights in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner.

ðŸ§  Approach / How I Solved It
Data Acquisition:

Used the World Bank Open Data on total population for all countries.

The dataset was read and cleaned using Pandas, skipping metadata rows.

Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Extracted relevant columns for the year 2022.

Removed entries with missing population values.

Visualization:

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to:

Plot a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 countries by population.

Display a histogram with KDE to visualize how population values are distributed across countries.

Insights:

The visualizations reveal population concentration among a few countries.

Distribution charts show the disparity between heavily populated and less populated nations.
